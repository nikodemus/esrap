;;; RULE REPRESENTATION AND STORAGE
;;;
;;; Each grammar, i.e. a named set of rules, is represented as a
;;; GRAMMAR instance. Grammars are named by strings and can be
;;; retrieved by name. In these regards, grammars behave similarly to
;;; Common Lisp packages.
;;;
;;; Dependencies between grammars (:USE-relations) are managed via
;;; GRAMMAR-REFERENTS and GRAMMAR-USE. Circular dependencies are
;;; currently not allowed.
;;;
;;; For each rule, there is a RULE-CELL in GRAMMAR-RULES, whose %INFO
;;; slot has the function that implements the rule in car, and the
;;; rule object in CDR. A RULE object can be attached to only one
;;; non-terminal at a time, which is accessible via RULE-SYMBOL.

(defmacro defrule (&whole form symbol-and-options expression &body options)
  "Define SYMBOL-AND-OPTIONS as a nonterminal, using EXPRESSION as associated parsing expression.

SYMBOL-AND-OPTIONS has to be one of:

  * SYMBOL

    Just names the new rule, no options.

  * (SYMBOL &KEY GRAMMAR)

    SYMBOL names the rule.

    GRAMMAR is a GRAMMAR-DESIGNATOR designating the grammar to which
    the new rule should be added.

When the specified containing grammar cannot be found at compile time,
a full warning is signaled. When the specified containing grammar
cannot be found at runtime, an error is signaled.

Following OPTIONS can be specified:

  * (:WHEN TEST)

    The rule is active only when TEST evaluates to true. This can be used
    to specify optional extensions to a grammar.

  * (:CONSTANT CONSTANT)

    No matter what input is consumed or what EXPRESSION produces, the production
    of the rule is always CONSTANT.

  * (:FUNCTION FUNCTION)

    If provided the production of the expression is transformed using
    FUNCTION. FUNCTION can be a function name or a lambda-expression.

  * (:IDENTITY BOOLEAN)

    If true, the production of expression is used as-is, as if (:FUNCTION IDENTITY)
    has been specified. If no production option is specified, this is the default.

  * (:TEXT BOOLEAN)

    If true, the production of expression is flattened and concatenated into a string
    as if by (:FUNCTION TEXT) has been specified.

  * (:LAMBDA LAMBDA-LIST &BODY BODY)

    If provided, same as using the corresponding lambda-expression with :FUNCTION.

    As an extension of the standard lambda list syntax, LAMBDA-LIST accepts
    the optional pseudo lambda-list keyword ESRAP:&BOUNDS, which (1) must appear
    after all standard lambda list keywords. (2) can be followed by one or two
    variables to which bounding indexes of the matching substring are bound.

    Therefore:

      LAMBDA-LIST ::= (STANDARD-LAMBDA-LIST-ELEMENTS [&BOUNDS START [END]])

  * (:DESTRUCTURE DESTRUCTURING-LAMBDA-LIST &BODY BODY)

    If provided, same as using a lambda-expression that destructures its argument
    using DESTRUCTURING-BIND and the provided lambda-list with :FUNCTION.

    DESTRUCTURING-LAMBDA-LIST can use ESRAP:&BOUNDS in the same way
    as described for :LAMBDA.

  * (:AROUND ([&BOUNDS START [END]]) &BODY BODY)

    If provided, execute BODY around the construction of the production of the
    rule. BODY has to call ESRAP:CALL-TRANSFORM to trigger the computation of
    the production. Any transformation provided via :LAMBDA, :FUNCTION
    or :DESTRUCTURE is executed inside the call to ESRAP:CALL-TRANSFORM. As a
    result, modification to the dynamic state are visible within the
    transform.

    ESRAP:&BOUNDS can be used in the same way as described for :LAMBDA
    and :DESTRUCTURE.

    This option can be used to safely track nesting depth, manage symbol
    tables or for other stack-like operations.
