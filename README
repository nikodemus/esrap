ESRAP -- a packrat parser for Common Lisp

In addition to regular Packrat / Parsing Grammar / TDPL features ESRAP
supports:

 - dynamic redefinition of nonterminals
 - inline grammars
 - semantic predicates
 - introspective facilities

Syntax overview:

 <literal>                 -- case-sensitive terminal
 (~ <literal>)             -- case-insensitive terminal
 character                 -- any single character
 (string length)           -- any string of length
 (and &rest sequence)
 (or &rest ordered-choises)
 (* greedy-repetition)
 (+ greedy-positive-repetition)
 (? optional)
 (& followed-by)           -- does not consume
 (! not-followed-by)       -- does not consume
 (<predicate> expr)        -- semantic parsing

 See file example-sexp.lisp for a complete sample grammar and usage.

Trivial examples:

 (parse '(or "foo" "bar") "foo")         => "foo", NIL

 (add-rule 'foo+ (make-instance 'rule :expression '(+ "foo"))) => FOO+

 (parse 'foo+ "foofoofoo")               => ("foo" "foo" "foo"), NIL

 (add-rule 'decimal
           (make-instance 'rule
            :expression '(+ (or "0" "1" "2" "3" "4" "5" "6" "7" "8" "9"))
            :transform (lambda (list)
                         (parse-integer (format nil "~{~A~}" list)))))
  => DECIMAL

 (parse '(oddp decimal) "123")                  => 123

 (parse '(evenp decimal) "123" :junk-allowed t) => NIL, 0
